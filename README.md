Description
-----------

Lucid is a Test Description Language (TDL) execution engine. It is, in many ways, a clone of the popular tool [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/). Lucid is diverging in many ways from Cucumber and similar tools but it does owe much of its initial structure to them.

This is an alpha release of Lucid as it strives to become its own entity in the world of BDD tools.


Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lucid'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lucid


Using Lucid
-----------

Much more detail on how to use Lucid will be coming soon. One way to get started however is to use the Lucid project generator. If you wanted to create a project directory called 'tutorial' for example, you could do this:

    $ lucid-gen project tutorial

In order to to check what options are available to you from the command line, do this:

    $ lucid --help

You should also check out some of my [blog posts related to Lucid](http://testerstories.com/?cat=24). They will take you through workflows of using the tool.
