Description

Lucid is undergoing a major shift from its Cucumber-like approach to one that is using a more lean approach based on using RSpec as a runner.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lucid'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself with the following:
