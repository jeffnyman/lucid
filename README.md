Description
-----------

Lucid is a Test Description Language (TDL) specification and execution engine. It is a clone of the popular tool [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/). Lucid is diverging in many ways from Cucumber but it does owe much of its initial structure to it. Lucid will also be incorporating some of the good ideas that have come to light in tools like [Spinach](https://github.com/codegram/spinach) and [Turnip](https://github.com/jnicklas/turnip).

This is an alpha release of Lucid as it strives to become its own entity in the world of BDD tools.


Installation
------------

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'lucid'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lucid
